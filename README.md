# DS5100_Project_Covid_and-Pre-existing_conditons
We conducted an analytical data analysis project about pre-existing conditions for COVID-19 and we built a command-line interface for anyone to interact with on their local machine.

# Follow these instructions to run this CLI on your local machine.

Before we go into the specific steps here are the python package dependencies to run this project:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. OS
4. imblearn
5. sklearn

1. Please make sure Python and Git as well as the packages above are installed on your computer.
2. Nagivate to the place on your local machine where you want to save this program.
3. Clone this github repository on your local machine using the Command Line. For example, if you are using a mac, you would run:
```
git clone https://github.com/AAT1iresh/DS5100_Project_Covid.git
```
4. From this point, you can run just run the user_input.py file directly to access the CLI. For example...
```
python3 user_input.py
```
5. Once the program was run, if you would like to run it again, just repeat step 4.
